## Overview of the BasicCalculator Program
### Objective
The primary objective of the BasicCalculator program is to provide a simple command-line interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation to perform, with the program returning the result of that operation.

### Key Activities
- **User Input**:The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
                 It then presents a menu of arithmetic operations and asks the user to select one.
  
- **Operation Selection**:The user selects an operation by entering a corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
  
- **Performing Calculations**:The program calls the performOperation method, which uses a switch statement to determine which arithmetic operation to execute based on the user's choice.
                              Each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is handled by its respective method.
  
- **Error Handling**:The program checks for division by zero in the divide method and provides an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.
  
- **Output**:The program displays the result of the selected operation to the user.
  
### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Input Handling**: Scanner class for reading user input from the console.
- **Control Structures**:Conditional statements (switch-case) for operation selection.
                         Methods for modular arithmetic operations.
  
### Key Insights
- **User -Friendly Design**: The program is designed to be interactive and straightforward, making it easy for users to perform calculations without needing advanced knowledge of programming.

- **Error Handling**: The program includes basic error handling for division by zero, which is a common issue in arithmetic calculations. This enhances the robustness of the application.

- **Scalability**: The program can be easily extended to include more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots) or additional features (e.g., handling multiple calculations in a single run).

- **Educational Tool**: This program serves as a practical example for beginners learning Java, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as input/output, control structures, and method creation.

### Conclusion
The BasicCalculator program is a simple yet effective tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. Its clear structure and user-friendly interface make it accessible to users of all skill levels. The design choices made in the program promote usability, maintainability, and scalability, ensuring that it can be adapted to meet future needs.
